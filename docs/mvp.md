## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This SDD lays out the implementation reference, architecture, and system design
for the MVP of Mu2 project (internally referred to as Mutato).

### 1.2 Scope

Mu2 is a CLI application tool and a consumable library, written in NodeJS, and
powered by AWS CDK. It has a sole purpose, and that is out of the box automation
for containerized applications on AWS ECS all in one place. The scope of this
project is simple:

> this tool was created to simplify the declaration and administration of the
> AWS resources necessary to support microservices.

In other words:

> The Serverless Framework but for Dockerized apps

### 1.3 Overview

This document gives a general description of the functionality, context and
design of Mutato's MVP in section 2. In section 3 of this document, a reference
for the implementation is presented with more details about the inner workings
of Mutato. Finally, section 4 defines a rough YAML schema consumed by Mutato.

### 1.4 Reference Material

- Mu1 (the original Mu project): <https://github.com/stelligent/mu>
- Mu1 examples and sample YAML files:
  <https://github.com/stelligent/mu/tree/develop/examples>
- AWS CDK and ecs-patterns module:
  <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/aws-ecs-patterns-readme.html>

### 1.5 Definitions and Acronyms

Throughout this document Mu, Mutato, and Mu2 are interchangeable and they all
refer to this repository's project.

## 2. Project Overview

Mu2 consumes a simple to write and comprehend YAML file that contains everything
about an infrastructure around a containerized application. This application can
have access to various databases, stay behind a load balancer, be served through
CloudFront or anything else that can be related to an ECS app.

The point of entry to Mu2 is a YAML file, named `mu.yml` by default. Mu2 in its
CLI form can be invoked by passing this YAML file in and a context directory.
Context directory is set to `$CWD` of where Mu2 CLI is being invoked.

Mu2 in its library form is a collection of useful CDK constructs that power Mu2
itself. The constructs can be used in any other CDK app. CLI's point of entry is
also provided as a consumable library function and returns a CDK stack.

Mu2 spins up a CI/CD Pipeline that manages the Dockerized application's DevOps
life-cycle from build to testing to deploy. A lot like Heroku pipelines.

Mu2 uses the current directory's GIT remote as CodePipeline's source input. For
the MVP only Github remotes are supported.

## 3. Project Architecture

### 3.1 Directory Layout

- `lib/`: is where Mu2 CDK constructs are at
- `bin/`: is where Mu2 CLI code is at
- `docs/`: where relevant docs and design references are at
- `tests/`: is where Mu2 unit tests are at

### 3.2 Program Architecture

Mu2/CDK constructs can be referenced in the `mu.yml` file. Constructs referenced
in the YAML file can be either in the form of a simple string or the following
format: `<package/path>/<construct name>`.

If the string version is given (no slashes in the name), the construct refers to
an internal Mu2 CDK construct under `lib/` (e.g `service` or `database`).

If the package format is given, Mu2 looks under context folder's `node_modules`
directory for the installed package and imports the construct that way. This is
how Mu2 can be extended. Extensibility is only possible in NodeJS for MVP. An
example would be `@aws-cdk/aws-ecs-patterns/ApplicationLoadBalancedEc2Service`.
The example breaks down to package: `@aws-cdk/aws-ecs-patterns` and named type
of `ApplicationLoadBalancedEc2Service`. Another example would be a local module:
`./my-app-constructs/index.js/MyCustomConstruct`. In this example, package is
`./my-app-constructs/index.js` and named type is `MyCustomConstruct`. Package
format resolution is as follows (in order):

1. Mu2 looks for the package under `node_modules`
1. If found, tries to import the type. If fails, proceed to the next step
1. Mu2 looks for a local folder in the context directory
1. If found, tries to import the type. If fails, this is fatal

Every single construct under `lib/` shares a base construct. This base construct
must allow for `async()` construction of all constructs. An example interface in
this model would be:

```JS
interface IBaseConstruct extends CDK.Construct {
  public abstract async synth(): Promise<void>;
}
```

### 3.3 YAML preprocessing

YAML ingested by Mu2 is a [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) file.
Naturally all features of Nunjucks are supported such as includes, blocks, loops
and dynamic function calls (Nunjucks filters).

The YAML is pre-processed before construct initialization. A version string must
indicate the version of Mu2 the YAML targets. The YAML file can contain the
following dynamic Nunjucks variables:

- environment strings: `{{ env(VAR) }}` resolves to the environment variable
- SSM parameters: `{{ ssm(property) }}`. String parameters resolved through SSM.
  StringList parameters are divided by their comma and turned into a javascript
  string array.
- AWS Secrets Manager parameters: `{{ asm(property) }}`. Parameters resolved by
  a lookup in AWS Secrets Manager.
- Shell command output: `{{ cmd(script) }}`. Parameter resolved by execution of
  a shell script on the machine executing Mu2.

`env`, `ssm`, `cmd`, and `asm` are custom Nunjucks filters provided by Mu2.

MVP does not concern itself with AWS authentication and multi-account deploys.
MVP simply invokes the CDK CLI and allows CDK to handle authentication.

Mu2 wraps the application's stack in a CI/CD pipeline that builds application's
Dockerfile, puts it through unit tests, and finally deploys to an ECS cluster.

The actual CI/CD pipeline is read from either a `buildspec.yml` file (in case of
CodePipeline) or `.drone.yml` (in case of Drone CI). Mu2 injects its own steps
inside the given pipeline. If none of these files are provided, Mu2 generates a
sample one for the user which is just functional enough to get the application
working and deployed.

### 3.4 MVP constructs

1. `service`: can be a Dockerfile running either on ECS-EC2 or Fargate
1. `database`: can have different engine types, focus on serverless
1. `storage`: can be either S3 or EFS mounted inside containers
1. `cache`: can be either Memcached or ElastiCache, or CloudFront
1. `queue`: can be a Dockerfile triggered by SQS task items
1. `task`: can be a Dockerfile triggered by CloudWatch
1. `cluster`: to customize the ECS service's cluster
1. `network`: to customize the VPC params
1. `cicd`: can be either CodePipeline or Drone CI
1. `ecr`: the ECR repository where operational Dockerfiles are stored at

MVP constructs are divided in three categories:

1. **operational**: `service`, `queue`, and `task`. All operational constructs
   involve a Dockerfile and somehow running it.
1. **utility**: `database`, `cache`, and `storage`. These constructs are
   magically linked to operational constructs, meaning that if user creates a
   `database` construct, it's automatically available to `service`, `task`, and
   `queue` constructs in the YAML file via environment variables to their
   Dockerfile during runtime. This is much like how Heroku plugins and Dynos
   work. If user creates a Heroku supported plugin, it auto-magically appears as
   environment variables inside Dynos. This also applies to the `storage`
   construct.
1. **infra**: infrastructure level constructs. These are necessary for utility
   and operational constructs to run. They include resources like a VPC and an
   ECS cluster. These constructs are currently `cluster`, `network`, and `cicd`

## 4. YAML Schema

```YAML
# this can be omitted, and if omitted, the current version of the CLI is assumed
version: 2.0

# this is static, top level stack key
mu:
  # name of the construct (used as ID when passed to CDK.Construct)
  app:
    # type of the construct (used as right hand side of new() upon construction)
    type: service
    # anything else other than "type" is serialized into an object and passed as
    # the third parameter to the CDK.Construct
    provider: fargate
    port: 8000
    env:
      - foo: bar
      # this is pre-processed to "DOO" env var
      - doo: {{ env("DOO") }}

  db:
    type: database
    provider: serverless-aurora
    engine: mysql
    username: {{ env("DB_USER") }}
    password: {{ ssm("/path/to/pass") }}

  data:
    type: storage
    provider: s3
    bucket: {{ env("BUCKET_NAME") }}
```
